# Kickstarting with Excel

## Overview of Project

### Purpose

The purpose of the project was to examine crowdfuding campaigns for theater projects and identify factors that contribute to their success or failure. To accomplish this, I used Excel to analyze crowdfunding data drawn from Kickstarter. Examining this dataset, I was able to identify the most months in which to launch a Kickstarter campaign, and the funding goals that are most likely to succeed.

## Analysis and Challenges

### Analysis of Outcomes Based on Launch Date

To display the outcomes of theater campaigns by their launch dates, I first created a pivot table using the data on the Kickstarter Worksheet. I added the Parent Category and Years fields to Filters, Outcomes to Columns, Date Create Conversion to Rows, and Count of Outcomes Values.

After creating the pivot table, I filtered Parent Category to show only theater campaigns, I filtered the column labels to exclude live campaigns, and I sorted the column labels in descending order.

I then created a line chart from the pivot table in order visualize the relationship between launch dates and campaign outcome.

### Analysis of Outcomes Based on Goals

The second part of my analysis looked at the relationship between funding goals and campaign success. On the Outcomes Based on Goals, I grouped campaign funding goals for theater campaigns into dollar-amount ranges. I calculated the number of successful, failed, and canceled campaigns for each dollar-amount range by using the COUNTIFS() function. For example, the following function displays the number of successful theater campaigns with goals between $1000 and $4999.

>=COUNTIFS(Kickstarter!$D:$D,">999",Kickstarter!$D:$D,"<5000",Kickstarter!$F:$F,"successful",Kickstarter!$Q:$Q,"theater")
>
I calculated the percentage of successful, failed, and canceled projects, and I created the following line chart to display the results.

### Challenges and Difficulties Encountered

I completed my analysis with very little difficulty. The analysis of outcomes based on goals required attention to detail to ensure that the correct pivot table fields are populated. The analysis of outcomes based on goals required a number of =COUNTIFS functions to count the correct number of successful, failed, and canceled campaigns for each funding goal range, and these need to be entered precisely. 

## Results

- What are two conclusions you can draw about the Outcomes based on Launch Date?

- What can you conclude about the Outcomes based on Goals?

- What are some limitations of this dataset?

- What are some other possible tables and/or graphs that we could create?
