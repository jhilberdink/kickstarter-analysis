# Kickstarting with Excel

## Overview of Project

### Purpose

The purpose of the project was to examine crowdfuding campaigns for theater projects and identify factors that contribute to their success or failure. To accomplish this, I used Excel to analyze crowdfunding data drawn from Kickstarter. Examining this dataset, I was able to identify the most months in which to launch a Kickstarter campaign, and the funding goals that are most likely to succeed.

## Analysis and Challenges

### Analysis of Outcomes Based on Launch Date

To display the outcomes of theater campaigns by their launch dates, I first created a pivot table using the data on the Kickstarter Worksheet. I added the Parent Category and Years fields to Filters, Outcomes to Columns, Date Create Conversion to Rows, and Count of Outcomes Values.

After creating the pivot table, I filtered Parent Category to show only theater campaigns, I filtered the column labels to exclude live campaigns, and I sorted the column labels in descending order.

I then created a line chart from the pivot table in order visualize the relationship between launch dates and campaign outcome.

### Analysis of Outcomes Based on Goals

### Challenges and Difficulties Encountered

## Results

- What are two conclusions you can draw about the Outcomes based on Launch Date?

- What can you conclude about the Outcomes based on Goals?

- What are some limitations of this dataset?

- What are some other possible tables and/or graphs that we could create?
